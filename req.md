# Paper
## Intro to topic

1. What are you researching?
2. Build the arguement you are trying to make?

4. You must cite sources to back up these claims

## Statistical Analysis
1. Describe your independent and dependent variables
2. Calc and provide descriptive stats for the sample and population (as needed)
3. Statistical test
    - State which test(s) you are using
    - Explain why you chose the test
    - Conduct the test. Include all of the steps. Effect size, if you reject, and supporting content (data viz, tables, calculations)

## Discussion
- Wrap up your findings
- Explain to a non-technical audience
- Was this successful? Why? Why not?

### Source Summary
### Tables if neccesary
### Probably, even though it's all code should do it by hand for her
